# first-d3-project
This is my first d3 project.
In this project I used json object for the first time. I used data that I use in my bachelor thesis, where I analyze heat consumption of a residental unit.

I used simple bar charts. Code is based on online book Interactive [Data Visualization for the Web](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345) and on youtube d3 tutorials made by [Brian Greg](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWF2dtHIaKINoDtcqWq5jiA).

This is also my first real GitHub project repository.

Sorry that the button text is in Czech.

Any advice or criticism is welcomed!

This project is running at https://loukotal.github.io/first-d3-project/.
